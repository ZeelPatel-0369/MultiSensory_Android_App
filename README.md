# MultiSensory_Android_App

 The Multi-Sensory Input Puck Project is a collaboration between CANSOFCOM (Canadian Armed Forces),and the software team. Vision of this project is to put technologically advanced armors around every soldier that stands for the safety of our country. As an initial step, this project is designed to enhance problem solving and decision making ability of the special forces operators. This  project consists of an android app with an advanced and elegant visual interface displaying data collected from a sensory device designed by engineering students. The resulting product will be used by CANSOFCOM to test data saturation and UI development, meaning to find out the maximum amount of displayed data that can be interpreted, understood, and be useful to ground troops. It is hoped that this project is redeveloped to a AR or VR application in the future to further enhance the skills of the soldiers and act as the sixth sense.
